# Fake News Detection with Machine Learning

This project presents a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classical classification algorithms. Built as a final project for *CSC 4505: Applied Machine Learning* at Villanova University, the system compares a wide range of models using both frequency- and embedding-based text representations.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Objective**: Classify news articles as real or fake using NLP-based feature extraction and machine learning.
- **Dataset**: [ISOT Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset), containing 44,919 labeled news articles with metadata (title, content, subject, date).
- **Models Tested**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Na√Øve Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Random Forest Classifier üåü (Best performing)
  - Gradient Boost Classifier
  - Word2Vec + Logistic Regression
  - Simple RNN
  - (Planned) LSTM

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF transformation, Word2Vec embedding.
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.
- Ensemble Learning: Demonstrated the effectiveness of bagging (Random Forest) and boosting (Gradient Boost).
- Visualization: Confusion matrices and distribution insights for data exploration.
